1. Do not use vectors or any dynamic container in production based software/program as it will take time to copy the complete size and not effecient use of AWS CPU memory.
   However, if array is used which is driven data type which give contigious memory. Their would be efficient efficient memory usage but it deprciate the performance of software.
   Therfore, use LL or it totally depends upon your scale.
